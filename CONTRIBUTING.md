## Running the App Locally

2. **Get Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command in your project directory:
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```

3. **Environment Setup:**
   - This project uses `.env` files for environment-specific configuration.
   - These files are listed in `.gitignore` and **should not be committed**.
   - You will need to manually create them:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p assets
     touch assets/.env.development
     touch assets/.env.production
     ```

   - Fill them with the necessary environment variables as needed. Contact a maintainer if you need help with the values.

4. **Run the App:**
   - Launch an emulator or connect a device, then run:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

5. **Run Tests (Optional):**
   - If you make changes that affect functionality, you can run tests:
     ```bash
     flutter test
     ```
